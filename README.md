Apply Intro patch, then this patch  

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH:  
*100% Item Spawns in Underground Pass, Routes 20 and 21, and in various locations around the Sevii Islands (credit to Dr. Maple for this code)

*100% Item Spawns in Mt. Moon for all 6 possible rng hidden items

*100% Run Away Chance from wild encounters to improve early pivoting and reduce the chance of dying to wilds. Now you only die to wilds if you choose to stay in the fight.  Works well in conjunction with the Max Level Wilds option in the randomizer fork

*Rock Tunnel is fully lit. There is no need to memorize the movement, run around in the dark, or try to find some way to unlock the flash HM

*Forgettable HMs. HMs are still attached to the reusable HM items, but can now be forgotten. The purpose of this is to enable the "HM moves learnable by level-up" option in the randomizer without having pokemon be stuck with HMs like Flash or Cut, and making them far less runnable
